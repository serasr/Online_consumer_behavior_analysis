# EDA and Predictive Analytics for Consumer Behavior and Revenue Generation for online shopping

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for exploratory data analytics and predictive analytics applied to consumer behavior data to forecast revenue generation for online shopping. The project involves data analysis, model training, and evaluation to provide actionable insights for businesses aiming to optimize sales performance and enhance customer engagement.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze consumer behavior data, including features such as the number of product-related pages visited, informational pages, bounce rates, etc., and develop predictive models to forecast revenue generation. This involves identifying patterns and trends in consumer behavior, understanding key drivers of revenue, and providing actionable recommendations for businesses.

## Approach
The project follows these steps:
1. Data Collection: Consumer behavior data is collected in the form of CSV file.
2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The data is explored to understand its structure and characteristics. Preprocessing steps may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to uncover patterns and insights in consumer behavior data, such as trends in website engagement, seasonal variations, and correlations between features.
4. Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected or created to improve model performance and interpretability.
5. Model Training: Logistic regression model is trained on the data to forecast revenue generation.
6. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its performance.
7. Insights Generation: Insights are derived from the model evaluations, highlighting key factors influencing revenue generation and providing actionable recommendations for businesses.
8. Documentation: The findings, insights, and recommendations are documented in a README file to communicate the project's outcomes effectively.

## Code Structure
- `DS`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights generation.
